\f0\fs24 \cf0 I will use be different hexadecimal color for different sections  during the final design. Anyone can choose what color he like on his design. There is no specific rule, but there is a recommendation that the background color should be less gluon than the text color. This kind of design is make more beautiful web site/ web page.But if your design is in the reverse, it should be more hard to read the text because the color of the text should invisible, observed by the color of the background.\
\
On my finalized design, I will choose \
Background color: #EDE7F6\
Body color: #FFFFF\
Text color: #KKKKKK\
\
I like the back ground color which is raush red color. For me it is very beautiful and white for body and black for text. These make very consistency  and easy to read the content with out any problem for your eyes. So any body has his own choose to stylize his design what ever he makes his design good to him. That  why any design determined by the designer.\
