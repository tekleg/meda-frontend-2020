    <h1> Cooking is my Hobby </h1>

    <h1>I Love Cooking</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy cooking because it keeps me happy in my life. Especially, I love cooking Habesha [Eritrean and
        Ethiopian] food. At first, I used to help my mom in her cooking. Through time, I found that I really enjoy
        cooking and my mom encouraged me to learn more. She taught me to step by step on how to cook vegetables. When I
        grew older, my knowledge of cooking also grew. My mom was the sole reason why I got better since she explained
        to me how to use temperature control.
    </p>

    <p> I remember that the first dish I made on my own without any kind of assistance was cabbage mixed with potatoes
        which are called alicha. I enjoyed it very much when it was backed in an oven. That day was really inspiring for
        me, everybody praised my dish and then I never looked back and never give up. That is why during my college
        years, I was enjoying cooking and I did not spend money in restaurant. I was keeping cooking and feeling healthy throughout the years.
